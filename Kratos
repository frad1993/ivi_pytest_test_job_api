The action begins shortly after the death of Kratos' second wife and Atreus' mother Fay, whose last will was to scatter her remains from the highest peak of all nine worlds. Before the journey Kratos is met by a stranger with divine powers, whose body is completely covered with tattoos. He demands answers from Kratos and taunts him about his past, which leads to a conflict that escalates into a fierce fight. After defeating the stranger, Kratos and Atreus set out on a journey.Upon reaching the Lake of Nine, Kratos and Atreus meet the friendly Yormungand, the world serpent, the last of the living giants of Midgard. Next they encounter the impenetrable black mist, a dark magic of unprecedented power, but the Forest Witch comes to their aid. She sends the heroes to the elf world, Alvheim, for light to fill the Bivr√∂st with it and pass through the mist. Climbing a mountain, they listen to a conversation between a stranger (revealed as Baldr) and Thor's sons Magni and Modi, and the captive Mimir. After the gods have gone, Kratos and Atreus talk to Mimir; the latter informs them that although the mountain in question is the highest in Midgard, the summit of all worlds is in Jotunheim, a world of giants that can only be reached through a closed portal.
